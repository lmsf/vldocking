# Lesson 10 : Compound Dockables #


This is the 10th part of the VLDocking Framework for Java Swing applications.


This lesson covers the Compound Dockables, which give a means to create nested hierarchy of dockables.


## Overview ##

Compound dockable containers is a feature available since VLDocking 2.1.


This feature adds support for nested containers, for example a Tabbed container in which would be nested splitted dockables.

## How does it work ? ##


VLDocking now contains a specialized Dockable, called CompoundDockable.


Unlike Dockable which is an interface, `CompondDockable` is a class, and it comes with an
associated Component : the `CompoundDockingPanel`. There shouldn't be any need to subclass  `CompoundDockable`.


You interact with `CompoundDockable` through its DockKey, which gives you a means
to name it, to give it an icon and a tooltip (as that what's DockKeys are meant to be...).


Nesting dockables is performed with the new DockingDesktop method
`addDockable(CompoundDockable base, Dockable dockable)` which can be used
to start nesting, and then standard `split()` or `createTab()`
methods can be used to alter the layout of the nested components.


> ### Example : creating a tab containing two dockable (horizontal split) ###


```
DockingDesktop desk = ...
Dockable tab1 = ...;
Dockable tab2 = ...;
CompoundDockable compound = new CompoundDockable(new DockKey("Nested"));
Dockable nested1 = ...;
Dockable nested2 = ...;
desk.addDockable(tab1);
desk.createTab(tab1, tab2, 1);
desk.createTab(tab1, compound, 2); // compound is added as a tab
desk.addDockable(compound, nested1); // now we insert nested1
desk.split(nested1, nested2, DockingConstants.SPLIT_RIGHT); // and we split it
```




Of course, another way of dealing with nested dockable is to use the
Workspace Manager Application
and load directly your layout from a workspace XML stream.
